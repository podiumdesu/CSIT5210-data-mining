## Proposal

Please write a proposal including the following items.

- A specific topic (or title) for this project
- Type of this project: Survey/Implementation/Research
- Group No.
- Information of each member of your group
  - Student ID
  - Student name
  - Your research/FYP supervisor (if any)
  - Your own research/FYP topic (if any) and an explanation why this project is different from your own research topic
  - A declaration statement that this project is done solely within the course but not other scopes (e.g., other courses and research projects)
- A brief description about this project (about 1000~2000 words)
- A list of papers to be read in this project

Note: It is suggested that you should do the whole project according to the proposal since you could plan ahead for your project with other groupmates earlier. However, if you want to change the project content after the project proposal, you are not encouraged. In this case, you could also approach the instructor for his approval and your project change could be accepted with justifications.

      - Note: Even though you write this paragraph in the single report (to be submitted once for the whole group), each individual member in the group are also required to fill in an individual online form to specify the percentage of contributions to the project *privately* with written contributions.
